# omahaPoker
Program that evaluates the winner of a 2-player Omaha-High Holdâ€™em poker game (also known as pot-limit Omaha).


High Card: Highest value card.
One Pair: Two cards of the same value.
Two Pairs: Two different pairs.
Three of a Kind: Three cards of the same value.
Straight: All cards are consecutive values.
Flush: All cards of the same suit.
Full House: Three of a kind and a pair.
Four of a Kind: Four cards of the same value.
Straight Flush: All cards are consecutive values of same suit.
Royal Flush: Ten, Jack, Queen, King, Ace, in same suit.
The cards are valued in the order:

2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace.

If two players have the same ranked hands then the rank made up of the highest value wins; for example, a pair of eights beats a pair of fives (see example 1 below). But if two ranks tie, for example, both players have a pair of queens, then highest cards in each hand are compared (see example 4 below); if the highest cards tie then the next highest cards are compared, and so on.
